# Termio docs — wiki

How the docs in this folder are organized. GitHub renders this as the landing
page when you browse `docs/`.

## How docs are organized

- Every doc lives **somewhere under `docs/`** and carries its own metadata in
  **YAML front matter** at the top of the file. Subfolders (`design/`,
  `competitive-analysis/`, …) are just loose grouping — the authoritative
  category is the front matter `type`, **not** the path.
- **Product promo assets and posts** (App Store shots, social covers, launch
  posts) live in a private sibling `marketing` repo, and **strategy / pitch
  markdown** in a private sibling `pitch` repo — neither ships here.
- Each doc declares: `title`, `status`, `type`, `created`/`updated`, and optional
  `related`. The front matter is the **single source of truth** for status —
  there is no separate status file to keep in sync.
- `status` moves down this line over a doc's life:
  `draft → in-review → approved → active → done → archived`.
- `type` is a label: `design` · `rfc` · `marketing` · `research` (add more only
  when a doc genuinely doesn't fit).

To create a new doc or ask "which docs are done / still in draft", use the `doc`
skill (`.claude/skills/doc/`) — it writes the front matter on create and scans it
live on query. Don't hand-maintain doc status anywhere but the doc itself.

## Index

The table below is **generated** from each doc's front matter — it is a derived
view, not a source of truth. The `doc` skill regenerates everything between the
markers; don't edit rows by hand (your edits would be overwritten and could drift
from the real front matter).
