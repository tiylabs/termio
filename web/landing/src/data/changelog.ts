    changes: {
      improved: [
        "Setting a machine up is putting the server and the hooks on it, and reaching the box is the only thing that can stop it. A machine with no agent CLI now says so in its own line instead of failing setup, and an agent you install afterwards is noticed.",
      ],
      fixed: [
        "Typing Chinese, Japanese, or Korean no longer puts the input method's candidate window on top of the characters you are typing.",
        "Hooks are written only for the agents that are on the machine, instead of for every agent in the catalog.",
        "Copying a file in Finder and pasting it into a terminal now gives its full path, not just its name.",

    changes: {
      improved: [
        "Settings: hooks and the agent skill now sit on a machine's Agents page, beside the CLIs they are written for, and Server has its own page apart from Remote Hosts.",
      ],
      fixed: [
        "Losing the connection to a session no longer strands its pane. Termio reconnects on its own — and immediately when you come back to the app — instead of asking you to close the session, which would have ended it.",
        "Dropping a file onto a split now hands it to the pane you can see, not to whichever pane happened to be mounted last.",
        "Plain-text files — a LICENSE, anything past the highlighting limit — are drawn in the theme's ink instead of black on a dark background.",
        "Collapsing the sidebar and reopening it no longer takes the navigator button, workspace name, sort menu and ＋ out of the toolbar for good.",
        "An ended session says what ended it in plain words, instead of showing the daemon's own vocabulary.",

    title: "Widening a terminal no longer leaves pieces of the old one behind",
    changes: {
      fixed: [
        "Widening a terminal — by dragging a split divider or a window edge, or by maximising the window — no longer leaves stray fragments of the previous width on screen.",

      fixed: [
        "Section labels and row icons in the sidebar now line up with the traffic lights, and the first section starts at the top of the column instead of below it.",

        "Diagrams and images in the reader open full screen.",
      ],
      fixed: [
        "Deleting a worktree's folder outside Termio no longer strands its row — the sidebar matches rows to git's own record and lets go of what git no longer tracks, and a checkout that isn't there offers no session.",

    version: "0.52.1",

    title: "Updates stop garbling running sessions",
    changes: {
      fixed: [
        "Updating Termio no longer leaves running sessions with garbled screens on the next reattach — a session carried across an update repaints cleanly the moment a phone or a Mac window opens it again.",

      ],
      improved: [
        "The session's size now stays where the last person put it: locking or backgrounding the iPhone no longer bounces the width back to an unattended Mac window, so picking the phone back up is instant instead of a full reflow.",
        "Opening the iPhone keyboard no longer resizes the terminal — the view slides just enough to keep the cursor's row above the keys, so agent screens stop repainting on every tap.",
      ],
      fixed: [
        "Resizing a session while its agent ran a shell command no longer truncates the agent's screen — lines rewrap to the new width with nothing lost, which was leaving stale fragments in transcripts after switching between Mac and phone.",

    title: "Remote projects launch agents",
    changes: {
      new: [
        "Remote projects launch agent sessions now, not just terminals: the box's own session host starts the agent through its login shell, in the recorded checkout, and the session survives disconnects like any other.",
        "Updating Termio updates this Mac's session host too: the daemon takes the new binary in place, keeping every running session. When that isn't free, Termio names the sessions in the way and asks instead of interrupting them.",

      improved: [
        "termio version flags a session host running behind the installed binary and says how to bring it current.",

    title: "Resizing reflows the shell",
    changes: {
      new: [
        "Resizing a session no longer cuts off long lines while the shell sits at a prompt — the screen rewraps to the new width in both directions, without duplicating the prompt. zsh gets this automatically; other shells keep the old behavior.",
      ],
      improved: [
        "The terminal reflows under the window edge while you drag, instead of waiting for the drag to end.",
      ],

        "Opening a session from the phone no longer resizes it to the Mac's window first, which was mangling agent TUIs' composer boxes on every open.",

    title: "The sidebar stops stalling the app",
    changes: {
      fixed: [
        "Beachballs traced to the sidebar are gone: rows measure their height without re-entering the list's own layout, the sidebar stops re-sizing itself on every update, and the working indicator ticks on a clock instead of on every repaint.",
        "The inspector keeps its width while the sidebar toggles, and its divider stays draggable after any split relayout.",
      ],
      improved: [
        "Sidebar icons are parsed once and cached, so a long session list scrolls without redoing that work per row.",

  {
    version: "0.49.0",
    date: "2026-09-04",
    title: "A remote checkout reads like a local one",
    changes: {
      new: [
        "The Changes pane reads a remote machine's checkout — status, diffs, history, and branch comparison — over the session host instead of shelling out over SSH, so a repo on a VPS behaves like one on this Mac.",
        "The file tree and content search go the same way. Search is ripgrep's own engine embedded in the host, and it honours the repo's excludes.",
        "Agents can carry their own startup arguments, set per agent in Settings.",
        "The termio command is a real binary now, shipped inside the app instead of a shell script — it fails loudly instead of guessing, and rejects a flag it does not know rather than passing it on as text.",
      ],
      improved: [
        "A session is sized to the screen someone is actually using. Working on the phone sizes it to the phone; typing on the Mac hands it back, and a window nobody is looking at stops holding it down.",
        "Workstream status is derived on the machine the session lives on, so a session opened straight from the phone reports without the Mac in the middle.",
      ],
      fixed: [
        "Resizing a window no longer mangles the screen. A drag now costs one repaint at the end instead of twenty racing the program's own redraw, the screen is captured after the program answers rather than before, and dragging outward grows the terminal with the window instead of leaving it in the corner until you let go.",
        "A pane you switch back to repaints instead of showing text wrapped at the width it had when you left it.",
        "Dev servers and test runners no longer die from running out of file descriptors — the session host raises the limit it hands the shells it spawns.",
        "A file sitting where the session host's socket belongs is never deleted, and stopping the host waits on the socket rather than on a pid and a filename.",
        "A terminal answering a query — a cursor or focus report — no longer counts as typing, so two devices watching one session stop fighting over it.",

      ],
      improved: [
        "When a machine can't be reached, its dot now carries ssh's own last words — \"Permission denied (publickey)\" instead of \"the connection closed\" — and a box without the session host installed says exactly that. Fix the network, switch back to the app, and it reconnects by itself.",
      ],
      fixed: [
        "A session whose pane wasn't on screen could freeze mid-turn: its screen served the same stale frame for minutes, watch missed the moment an agent finished, and send --wait came back while the target was still working. Hidden panes now keep processing their output; only the drawing pauses.",
        "An agent that exited back to its shell no longer loses its row to Also Running — the row demotes in place, and closing a session that never rendered a pane really closes it.",
        "Reattaching could land the screen a line off and eat the bottom row; the repaint now puts everything back exactly where it was.",
        "Linux: a reboot no longer renames the box or disarms its phone listener — the session host's identity and pairing state moved to a directory that survives restarts, and pair --rotate really revokes the old token everywhere.",
        "Font and theme inheritance reads Ghostty's config the way Ghostty does: the config.ghostty filenames, light:/dark: theme pairs, and CRLF-saved files all parse now.",
