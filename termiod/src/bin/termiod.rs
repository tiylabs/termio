//! termiod — durable session host (POC).
//!
//! Architecture (three parts): **host** · **protocol** · **clients**.
//! `termiod serve` is the host; other subcommands are reference clients
//! (or SSH transport helpers). Detach never kills a session.
//! Local = remote to localhost over a Unix socket.
//!
//! See `ARCHITECTURE.md` and `README.md`.
