//! What the daemon knows about its own box.
//!
//! Three bugs in the SSH arm existed only because the writer was on the wrong
//! machine, and none of them is ported here:
//!
//! - `$HOME` needed three escapings — raw, shell, and JavaScript — because the
//!   binary path was a shell *expression* the remote had to expand. A daemon
//!   knows its own executable's absolute path.
//! - `~/.config` had to be spelled `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}` so a
//!   remote shell would resolve it. Here it is one `std::env::var`.
//! - The CLI probe had to ask a login shell twice, because `ssh host cmd` gets a
//!   minimal `PATH`. A daemon *also* does not always inherit the user's `PATH`
//!   (it is auto-started from an SSH command or a launchd job, exactly as the Mac
//!   app is started from Finder), so the login-shell probe stays — but as the one
//!   mechanism it always was, asked once and cached, not as an SSH workaround.
