//! Installing termio's agent integration into the agent config files on this box.
//!
//! Two write problems wearing one Settings toggle. **A skill is a file; a hook
//! is a merge.** The skill is one whole document termio owns at
//! `<skillDir>/termio/SKILL.md`; a hook goes into a file the user also owns and
//! edits, so every rule below is about not damaging it:
//!
//! - never overwrite a config that does not parse — a file we cannot read is a
//!   file we cannot merge into, and rewriting it would discard whatever it held;
//! - never claim a file that is not ours — `termio.js` is a plausible name for a
//!   user's own plugin, and a script named after a lifecycle event is a
//!   plausible name for a user's own hook;
//! - strip the third-party writers in [`CONFLICTING_HOOK_MARKERS`] that
//!   full-replace the shared `hooks` block instead of merging into it, so the
//!   next destructive writer cannot out-merge us;
//! - write nothing when the bytes already match.
//!
//! A fifth rule only shows up on the *second* install: **it must replace what
//! the last one wrote.** Each dialect recognises its own work differently — a
//! JSON group by its command, a script and a plugin by their marker, the TOML
//! block by its banner — and every one has to hold, or a reinstall doubles the
//! hooks instead of refreshing them.
//!
//! See `docs/design/20260825-agent-integration-moves-to-termiod.md`. The
//! generated plugin sources live in [`super::plugin`].
