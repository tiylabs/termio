//! Session Protocol v0.1 — the wire contract between clients and `termiod`.
//!
//! Framing is frozen from v0:
//!
//! ```text
//! [ kind: u8 ][ len: u32 big-endian ][ payload: len bytes ]
//! ```
//!
//! Control and event payloads are JSON. PTY data stays raw and the viewport
//! frame stays a four-byte binary payload, so v0 clients remain byte-compatible.
//!
//! `R` names an *attachment's viewport*, not the PTY's size. The host derives
//! the PTY size from the set of viewports that are currently rendering — see
//! `session::Session::apply_size_policy` and
//! `docs/design/20260901-pty-size-is-not-the-write-token.md`.
