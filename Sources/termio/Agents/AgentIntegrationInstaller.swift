/// This replaces `AgentConfigStore` and both installers. The machine that owns
/// the agent config files decides what goes in them: this side states
/// *preferences* — which agents are on the user's list, whether each switch is
/// on, what a hook should invoke — and `termiod` works out where every agent
/// keeps its config, whether its CLI is even there, which of six dialects to
/// merge into, and what to write. See
/// `docs/design/20260825-agent-integration-moves-to-termiod.md`.
///
/// What that buys, measured: a twelve-agent install on a device was forty to
/// sixty sequential `ssh` invocations, each a `Process` with `waitUntilExit()`.
/// It is now one round trip.
///
/// **Installing on this Mac is now an IPC call too.** That is
/// `one-path-local-through-termiod`'s thesis and not a new cost — but it is a
/// new failure mode, so it is handled rather than assumed: `Transport.open`
/// already auto-starts `termiod serve` when nothing answers, which is the same
/// spawn every local session depends on, so "the daemon was not running" is a
/// state this recovers from rather than one it reports. What it cannot recover
/// from — no daemon binary at all — is reported, never swallowed, because a Mac
/// that could always install its own hooks must not start failing quietly.
