/// conflating them is what made Settings mean "this Mac" in the first place:
///
/// - **Authored** — the command path the user chose for an agent on that box.
///   A choice, so it belongs beside every other choice in `settings.json` and
///   survives anything.
/// - **Discovered** — whether the box answered, whether a CLI is on its `PATH`.
///   A probe result, so it belongs in `~/.termio/devices/<host_id>.json` and is
///   safe to delete at any moment.
///
/// The rule that keeps them apart: **the discovered file is never read as
/// authority.** It exists so a machine's pane can draw something the instant it
/// opens instead of an empty pane with a spinner, and every value in it is
/// replaced by a live probe as soon as one answers. One read path that trusts it
/// recreates the bug this whole split exists to fix.
