/// The Agents tab as a drill-down, the shape System Settings ▸ Notifications has:
/// one pane holding a grouped roster of agents, each row carrying its mark, its
/// name and a status line, and each row pushing that agent's configuration onto the
/// settings window's own navigation stack. The earlier master–detail split gave the
/// window a third column no other tab had.
///
/// This tab is *what you use*: the enabled set, the order, the default agent and
/// the integration switches are preferences, and they have no machine dimension.
/// The values that do — where a CLI lives, whether it is there — are shown here
/// **once per machine**, never behind a machine picker.
///
/// A picker was tried and is the thing this shape exists to replace. It is a
/// mode: a control that changes what the rest of the page means, so the machine
/// has to be remembered rather than read, a mis-remembered one quietly configures
/// the wrong box, and the machines you are *not* looking at — the ones missing a
/// CLI — are exactly the ones it hides. It also does not generalise: every other
/// page touching a machine would need its own copy, and the phone would need one
/// too.
///
/// So machines are rows. A machine is chosen by navigation — Settings ▸ Server,
/// or a row in Settings ▸ Remote Hosts — and never by a control on a page about
/// something else. The property that makes this affordable everywhere: **a roster
/// of one renders exactly as this page did before there was more than one
/// machine** — no list, no labels, no bar. A picker with one option cannot do
/// that; it still costs a row.
